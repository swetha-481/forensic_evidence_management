# Blockchain-Based Forensic Evidence Management System

This project is designed to securely manage and track forensic evidence using blockchain technology.

Handling forensic evidence requires strong integrity and traceability. Traditional systems rely on centralized databases, which can be vulnerable to tampering or unauthorized modifications.

This system uses blockchain to maintain an immutable and transparent record of evidence movement and custody.

---

## Problem

Managing forensic evidence through manual or centralized systems can lead to:

* Tampering risks
* Lack of transparency
* Difficulty in verifying chain of custody
* Limited accountability

Ensuring that evidence remains unchanged throughout its lifecycle is critical in investigations.

---

## Solution

This project introduces a blockchain-based approach to:

* Register forensic evidence securely
* Record custody transfers
* Maintain tamper-proof history
* Track evidence status

Each transaction related to evidence is stored as a block, creating an immutable audit trail.

---

## Key Features

* Secure evidence registration
* Blockchain-based chain of custody
* Tamper-resistant data storage
* Evidence status tracking
* Transparent activity logs
* Role-based access

---

## System Workflow

Evidence Collection
→ Digital Registration
→ Blockchain Record Creation
→ Custody Transfer Logging
→ Analysis Tracking
→ Final Archival

Each stage is stored as a blockchain transaction.

---

## Role of Blockchain

Blockchain ensures:

* Data integrity
* Transparency
* Non-repudiation
* Immutable history

Once recorded, evidence details cannot be altered without detection.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Flask
* Blockchain Framework 
* SQLite 

---

## Modules

* Evidence Registration
* Custody Transfer Logging
* Blockchain Ledger
* Status Monitoring
* User Access Control

---

## Benefits

* Prevents unauthorized changes
* Improves accountability
* Provides verifiable custody history
* Strengthens trust in evidence handling

---

## Future Scope

* Integration with national forensic systems
* QR-based evidence tagging
* Smart contract-based custody validation
* Cloud-based deployment

---

## Conclusion

This system demonstrates how blockchain can enhance forensic evidence management by ensuring secure, traceable, and tamper-proof handling throughout the investigation process.
